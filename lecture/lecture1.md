???
What makes these AI systems really different is that they offer a new interface. AI is no longer embedded in tools but in direct contact with us, humans.

For example, Med-PaLM 2 is a large language model tuned for the medical domain. It can be interacted with using natural language, as if you were talking to a medical expert. You do not need to know how to write code or how to define these mathematical models. You just ask a question, and it will give you an answer.

## AlphaFold: From a sequence of amino acids to a 3D structure

AlphaFold is a neural network based on the trasnformer architecture that can predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence.

This problem is important because the 3D structure of a protein determines its function, and understanding protein function is key to understanding biology and designing new drugs.

However, determining the 3D structure of a protein experimentally is difficult and expensive, taking up to months just to solve a single structure.

AlphaFold has been a breakthrough in this area, and has been able to predict the 3D structure of proteins with high accuracy, in just a couple of minutes for the longest sequences.

## Drug discovery with graph neural networks

.center.width-80[![](./figures/lec1/cell.png)]

???

A second example is the use of graph neural networks to discover new drugs.

Discovering new drugs is a complex and expensive search problem, where the goal is to find molecules that will bind to a target protein and modulate its function. Unfortunately, this problem is difficult for two reasons:

  - first, the search space is huge -- the space all possible pharmacologically active molecules is estimated to be in the order of 10^60 molecules.
  - second, the binding of a molecule to a protein is a complex process that is difficult to model. Laboratory experiments are necessary to evaluate the binding of a molecule to a protein, and these experiments are expensive and time-consuming.

Graph neural networks have been a breakthrough in this area, and have been able to predict the properties of molecules with high accuracy.

In a sense, they can serve as a virtual laboratory that can be used to pre-screen millions of molecules in a matter of hours, thereby reducing the laboratory work to only the most promising candidates.
